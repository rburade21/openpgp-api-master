    <string name="library_OpenPGPAPILibrary_libraryDescription">The OpenPGP API provides methods to
        execute OpenPGP operations, such as sign, encrypt, decrypt, verify, and more without user
        interaction from background threads. This is done by connecting your client application to a
        remote service provided by OpenKeychain or other OpenPGP providers.</string>
